                                    A long time ago, in a place not too far away, as Martin Gontovnikas turned 12 years old, two important events happend:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Martin's school friends realized that there were 3 other Martin in the class, and therefore, started calling him <strong>"Gonto"</strong>.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Last but not least, Gonto's uncle, a system engineer, started showing him the magic of programming by teaching him one of the most hated programming languages of all time: <strong>Visual Basic 6</strong>.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    At the age of 16, Gonto had already programmed lots of different video games with Visual Basic 6 like Simon Says, Buraco, Truco &amp; Black Jack. He also joined a forum called Gamesario, and helped coding parts of a game called Argentum Online, also with VB6.

                                <p>When Gonto reached the age of 18th, not only he started to grow a beard, but also he started studying <strong>Systems Engineer</strong> at UTN (National Technology University). Since college was a few hours per day, he was bored, and he knew how to code, he also started his first paid job at <a rel="external" href="#">Globant</a>, one of the biggest software consulting firms in Argentina. He was coding in C# and did apps for SourceForce and Electronic Arts among others. </p>

                                <p>1.5 years later, Gonto started learning about Open Source and was really engaged with it. Considering that there weren't too many open source projects around .Net technologies at that time, he made the switch to Java, and worked on projects like <a rel="external" href="#">Playphone</a> and <a rel="external" href="#">Orbitz</a>.</p>

                                <p>Another 1.5 years later, Gonto decided to switch companies and started to work at <a rel="external" href="#">Zauber</a>. It was a software boutique where he knew he could grow a lot and learn lots of different programming languages like Scala, Ruby, Javascript and others. He became a project leader there, leading teams of up to 5 people.</p>

                                <p>After 3 more years, Gonto felt that it was time to start giving back to the community which helped him learn so many different languages and frameworks. This is when Gonto started doing freelancing and building his own Open Source projects. Looking back, this is the decision that started changing to course of his carrer, getting him nearer to Marketing.</p>

                                <p>Gonto built <a rel="external" href="#">Restangular</a>, <a rel="external" href="#">Angular Wizard</a>, <a rel="external" href="#">Factory Pal</a>, and <a rel="external" href="#">Angularytics</a> among other open source projects. Some of these prjoects are used nowadays by Fortune 500 companies around the world like Weather.com and Reuters.</p>
                                <p>The most interesting part about this is how these projects got to be popular. Even though he didn't know it at that point in time, the answer is developer marketing. Martin wrote ton of articles about Restangular and adjacent technologies (like AngularJS) in his blog, he distributed these blog posts on news aggregators and sent them to influential people to review and share, he also actively searched and answered questions on Stackoverflow and Quora related to them, and started talking and engaging with other open source developers.</p>
                                <p>All of these led him to <strong>AngularJS Mountain View meetup</strong>, where he did the first talk of his life. As you can see from the video, he was so nervous, he sounded like a robot, as you can see from the comments of the video itself. But this didn't stop him, and he got invited to his first conference, DevoxxFR, where he did 2 really engaging talks.</p>

                                <p>This new things that have been happening in Gonto's life are what brought him to <a rel="external" href="#">Auth0</a>. He joined Auth0 as a <strong>Developer Evangelist</strong>, which is a mix of Marketing and Development. His job included giving talks in different conferences around FrontEnd technologies, Security, and APIs among other things, as well as writing blog posts, writting documentation for the product, as well as SDKs for the different technologies.</p>

                                <p>The more that Gonto worked as a Developer Evangelist, the more he realized that he liked Marketing. He eventually became the Head of Marketing, having more than 20 people on his team. As explained in the home page, thanks to his background, Gonto has a really new approach to Marketing, where anything can be tried, but it must be treated as an experiment, which must have a hypothesis, a goal and some metric to measure it. Gonto's main slogan at Auth0 is:</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    "Better to ask for forgiveness than permission. You have an idea and a way to measure it? Just try it!"
                                </blockquote>
