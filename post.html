                    If youâ€™re here, it means youâ€™ve heard about the greatness of Inbound Marketing. You donâ€™t have to go find strangers and turn them into leads. People just arrive to your site and turn to leads themselves.
                    However, if youâ€™re building a <a rel="external" href="https://www.bvp.com/developer-platforms">Developer Platform</a> (also called a B2D), you know that developers arenâ€™t typical people (Trust me, I'm one of them as well ðŸ˜„). In this blog post, Iâ€™ll go over 5 ways you can target developers with your content marketing.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Write generic development content with an aside</h2>

                <p>
                    The most important thing a developer should know is how to search on Google I'd say (no offence intended) that a developer job is ~50% of the time searching on Google for solutions. If you write content that's specific to your product (use cases, why you should use it, etc.) nobody will ever find it, nor read it nor share it.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Side note:</strong> I'll be talking about the <a href="#">seed project</a> in an upcoming post.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    However, if you write insightful tips, tricks, solutions, benchmarks, etc. and you have a good SEO (we'll cover this in another post), there're big chances people will land in your blog after doing a google search. Even greater, if the content is good, they'll probably share it on Twitter amplifying your reach for free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, youâ€™re probably asking, if I write awesome posts not related to my product, how is that going to convert to possible leads to my product? <span class="highlighted">Well, thatâ€™s easy :). On every blog post, add an `Aside` which will explain how this solution, tip or trick was actually used in your product. For example, when Relay (from Facebook) was released, at Auth0 we did <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2015/10/06/getting-started-with-relay/">an intro post</a>, and we wrote an aside about how to integrate it with Auth0.</span>
                </p>

                </figure>


                <h2>2. Write post series</h2>

                <p>
                    Usually, when somebody comes back to your site, theyâ€™re more likely to signup. You can leverage this behaviour by simply writing a series of post on the same subject, and making it clear in the first one that thereâ€™s going to be a new one at an specific date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, at Auth0 we did a benchmark series where each week we do a performance benchmark between a different set of FrontEnd frameworks.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <h2>3. Github (and open source) is your friend</h2>

                <p>
                    Developers love Open Source software, basically because most times it means less work for them. If they need to implement some machine learning algorithm and somebody has coded an open source project that implements it, theyâ€™re just going to use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why you should ALWAYS write as much open source software as you can. Github is always up on Google searches so if a developer is searching for a solution he might just find your repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can you convert this traffic to leads? Just add a link to the announcement from your blog and some credit about your company. If thatâ€™s not enough, doing open source will also help you with hiring ðŸ’ª. Developers love to work on open source projects!
                </p>

                    </div><!-- .actions -->
                </blockquote>


                <h2>4. Have a newsletter</h2>

                <p>
                    As I said on the tip #2, the more your visitors come back, the more likely theyâ€™re to convert. This is why you should always have a blog newsletter. If you have great content, people will subscribe and theyâ€™ll come back later on for more great articles to your site.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Distribution matters</h2>

                <p>
                    If you have great content, but nobody can reach it, itâ€™s like you havenâ€™t written anything at all! This is why itâ€™s really important to have great SEO (Iâ€™ll cover this in an upcoming post) as well as knowing where to share the post.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, if youâ€™re writting about Javascript and your post gets sent in JSWeekly, youâ€™ll have lots of traffic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's analyze what we're doing there! The equivalent of the previous <code>watch</code> function is this line which basically just calls simultaneously (notice it's doing <code>&</code> and not <code>&&</code>) 2 other tasks from the <code>package.json</code> and the <code>serve</code> function which is installed as a dev dependency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, let's checkout the <code>watch-js</code> and <code>watch-css</code> tasks. They both just call the cli for <code>watchify</code>, <code>nodemon</code> and <code>rework</code> which were installed as dev dependencies as well.
                </p>
