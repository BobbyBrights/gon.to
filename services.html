                <h3>Developer Platform</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>What is it:</strong> B2D are a new ecosystem of companies that bypasses traditional enterprise IT and sells directly to developers via the cloud. B2Ds are a subclass of a B2B, since the developers youâ€™re selling to are part of a company which eventually buys the SaaS subscription.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Why me:</strong> Being a developer and system engineer gives me the right background and perspective to be able to successfully market to developers.

            <div class="">
                <h3>Business to Business</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>What is it:</strong> A B2B is a typical case where a company is selling a software or a service subscription to another company.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Why me:</strong> My engineering background and my marketing experience gives me the right mindset to create and optimize data driven marketing experiments to target companies.
